# Philosophy

Agents are **constrained roles**, not general-purpose assistants. Each agent has a narrow purpose, strict inputs/outputs, and explicit boundaries. This keeps workflows reliable, testable, and auditable.

## Shadow Logs as Conscience

A shadow agent records decisions, confirmations, and changes in direction. It does not alter plans or outputs. The log is an audit trail that explains *why* a choice was made and *what evidence* supported it.

## Compassionate Layer

A compassion agent is a communication hygiene layer. It adds supportive or clarifying text without changing technical content. The goal is to reduce confusion and improve collaboration, not to alter facts or plans.
